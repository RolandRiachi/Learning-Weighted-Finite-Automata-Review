	Picture an owner of a shipping company trying to study the logistics of their business; profit gener-ated by a shipment would depend largely on the kind of good being transported, its origin, and itsdestination.  With potentially infinite choices of delivery routes, the owner would likely be interestedin a finite, ideally minimal, description of possible profits.

	This desire to model quantitative systems is what motivates the study of learning weighted finiteautomata (WFA). In fact, algorithms to design WFAs mimicking such systems boast applications inmany fields; for example, image processing [25, 30], speech recognition [29, 31, 35], speech synthesis[1,  38],  phonological  and  morphological  rule  compilation  [26,  27,  33],  parsing  [32],  bioinformatics[2, 20], sequence modeling and prediction [19], formal verification [3], optical character recognition[16], and more.

In this paper we report some techniques for learning WFAs reviewed by Balle and Mohri [7].The  goal  is  to  illustrate  some  relatively  new  approaches  to  the  problem  (namely,  learning  WFAsfrom queries [13, 14], learning stochastic WFAs from i.i.d.  samples [6, 24], and a learning WFAs -not necessarily probabilistic - from finite string-value pair samples [10]), to clarify some proofs andto provide hopefully insightful intuition into the motivations and definition behind each technique.
